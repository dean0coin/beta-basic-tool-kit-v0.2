Basic Tool Kit v0.2 (Newer Version of Basic Tool Kit)

basic tool kit (meant to test out my python skills after 2 months not using it) nothing special/impressive.

REMEMBER!! This is a BETA. It has a few basic tools, you cant go back to menu after using one, and some other inefficient bugs. I WILL fix this.
